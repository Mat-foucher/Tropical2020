        Subdivide the family in place at ``basicFamily`` based at ``elt``

        This function subdivides the family in place. ``basicFamily`` is replaced with three other
        basic families, all of which are obtained by modifying the underlying monoid of ``basicFamily``.
        Letting ``M`` denote the monoid associated to ``basicFamily``, the three new basic families are
        identical to ``basicFamily`` except their underlying monoids are ``M[elt]``, ``M[-elt]``, and
        ``M[elt, -elt]``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        basicFamily : :class:`~Tropical2020.basic_families.BasicFamily.BasicFamily`
            the basic family at which to subdivide
        elt : ``basicFamily.m.Element``
            the element determining the subdivision

        Warnings
        --------
        ``elt`` must be an instance of ``basicFamily``'s :class:`~Tropical2020.basic_families.RPC.Monoid`.
